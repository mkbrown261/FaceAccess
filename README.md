## ✅ Completed Features

### 🔬 Developer Testing Lab (v1.0 — NEW at `/dev-lab`)
Internal sandbox environment for validating biometric pipeline accuracy, enrollment quality, and trust engine logic — fully isolated from production data.

**Six integrated panels:**

1. **Face Enrollment Panel**
   - USB webcam / laptop camera / optional RTSP stream connection
   - Start/stop/switch camera controls with real-time feed
   - Live quality metrics: brightness, sharpness, anti-spoof score
   - 7-angle progress dots (center, left, right, up, down, left_up, right_up)

### Multi-Model Biometric Pipeline (v4.0 — Latest)
- **Tiered Recognition Pipeline**: Face detection → Alignment → ArcFace primary → Cosine check → If borderline → InsightFace secondary → FaceNet tertiary
- **ArcFace ResNet100** — 512-dim embeddings, primary model (weight 50%), angular margin softmax, highest discriminability
- **InsightFace MobileNetV3** — 256-dim embeddings, secondary model (weight 30%), fast inference for borderline cases
- **FaceNet Inception** — 128-dim embeddings, tertiary model (weight 20%), invoked only when first two disagree
- **Score Fusion Formula**: `combined = ArcFace×0.50 + InsightFace×0.30 + FaceNet×0.20`
- **Borderline Detection** — Scores 60-90% trigger secondary verification automatically
- **Model Agreement Score** — Measures consistency between all active models; low agreement flags suspicious cases
- **Edge AI Preprocessing** — Face alignment, landmark detection, anti-spoof pre-check run on-device before cloud verification
- **Continuous Learning Engine** — EMA-based template adaptation after successful authentications (α=0.05 update per success)
- **Full Audit Logging** — Every authentication decision logged with all model scores, latency, and decision path

### AI Trust Engine v4
- **Multi-Model Trust Formula**: `trust = face_avg×0.35 + behavioral×0.35 + predictive×0.20 − penalty×0.10`
- **Per-Model Tracking** — `arcface_avg`, `insightface_avg` stored per user in trust profiles
- **Trust Score History** — Time-series of trust score changes for trend visualization
- **Tiers**: `trusted` (≥85%) instant unlock; `standard` (≥60%); `watchlist` (≥40%) extra verification; `blocked` (<40%)
- **EMA Adaptation** — α=0.15 for stable trust evolution
- **Behavioral Model** — Continuous learning of typical arrival times, doors, device proximity patterns
- **Behavioral Drift Detection** — Compares recent vs 7-day prior pattern distributions; flags significant shifts

### Biometric Audit Log (Compliance)
Every authentication decision records:
- Decision: `granted` | `denied` | `pending` | `error`
- All model scores: `arcface_score`, `insightface_score`, `facenet_score`, `combined_confidence`
- `anti_spoof_score`, `liveness_score`, `edge_confidence`, `quality_score`
- Pipeline trace: `stage_reached` (e.g., `edge→arcface→insightface→fusion`)
- `pipeline_latency_ms`, `model_agreement`, `is_borderline`
- Trust context: `trust_score`, `trust_tier`, `behavioral_typical`, `anomaly_score`
- Device signals: `ble_detected`, `wifi_matched`, `proximity_score`

### Core Face Recognition
- Liveness detection (eye-open ratio, motion history, challenge-response)
- Anti-spoofing: contrast variance, Sobel texture, highlight ratio, screen artifact detection
- Cosine similarity matching against AES-256 encrypted embeddings
- Confidence tiers: High ≥85% (auto-grant), Medium 65–84% (triggers 2FA), Low <65% (denied)
- Phone proximity verification (BLE + WiFi)
- Multi-angle enrollment: 7 angles, 3 liveness challenges

### FaceAccess Home
- Multi-lock smart home security (August, Schlage, Yale, Nuki, Generic)
- Real-time face recognition at door via FaceID Engine v2.0
- Guest pass management with time windows and day restrictions
- Remote approval: push notification → mobile approve/deny
- Device registration + BLE proximity fingerprinting

### Security & Privacy
- AES-256 GCM encrypted biometric embeddings (Web Crypto API)
- GDPR-compliant biometric erasure (`DELETE /api/home/users/:id/face`)
- Server-side rate limiting: 10 attempts/min per lock
- Client-side rate limiting: 5 attempts/min with 60s lockout
- Hard rejection: anti-spoof score < 0.35, liveness < 0.50
- No raw photos stored; only 512-dim normalized vectors

## Data Architecture

### Storage: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)

**Core tables:**
- `homes`, `home_users`, `home_devices`, `smart_locks`, `home_cameras`
- `guest_passes`, `home_events`, `home_verifications`, `home_automations`

**AI tables (v3.0):**
- `user_trust_profiles` — Dynamic trust scores with EMA
- `behavioral_patterns` — Raw time-series access events (w/ multi-model scores)
- `anomaly_events` — Detected anomalies with severity and trust delta
- `predictive_sessions` — Predicted arrival windows
- `ai_recommendations` — Auto-generated access management suggestions

**Multi-model tables (v4.0):**
- `biometric_audit_log` — Full compliance audit record for every authentication
- `multimodel_embeddings` — Per-model embedding storage (ArcFace, InsightFace, FaceNet)
- `behavioral_models` — Continuous learning state with drift detection
- `trust_score_history` — Time-series of trust score changes

### Multi-Model Pipeline Algorithms

**Score Fusion:**
```
combined = arcface × 0.50 + insightface × 0.30 + facenet × 0.20
adjusted = combined × (anti_spoof_adjustment) × (0.90 + edge_confidence × 0.10)
```

**Trust Score:**
```
trust = face_avg × 0.35 + behavioral × 0.35 + predictive × 0.20 - penalty × 0.10
EMA:  new = prev × 0.85 + current × 0.15  (α = 0.15)
```

**Anomaly Types:**
| Type | Severity | Trust Delta |
|------|----------|-------------|
| spoof_attempt | critical | −25% |
| repeated_failures | high | −15% |
| unusual_time | high | −12% |
| off_schedule | medium | −5% |
| behavioral_drift | low | −3% |

**Borderline Handling:**
- If ArcFace score 0.60–0.90 → automatically invoke InsightFace
- If ArcFace & InsightFace disagree by >10% → invoke FaceNet
- Model agreement = 1 - std_dev(all_scores) × 4
